                <p>Bengaluru, known as India’s Silicon Valley, has taken a significant step towards tackling its notorious traffic congestion by launching the country’s first AI-powered traffic management system. The system, inaugurated on January 19, 2025, aims to optimize traffic flow, reduce delays, and enhance road safety across the city.</p>
                <p>Developed by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) in collaboration with tech companies, the system employs real-time data from cameras, sensors, and GPS-enabled vehicles. Advanced algorithms analyze the data to predict traffic patterns, adjust signal timings, and provide live updates to commuters through mobile apps and digital boards installed at major intersections.</p>
                <p>According to BBMP officials, the AI system has been implemented at 50 key junctions in the city during its first phase. Over the next year, it will expand to cover 300 intersections. The project, worth ₹150 crore, is expected to reduce average commute times by 30%.</p>
                <p>Speaking at the launch, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah praised the initiative as a game-changer for urban mobility. “This system aligns with Bengaluru’s vision of becoming a smart city and showcases how technology can solve real-world problems,” he said.</p>
                <p>Local residents and commuters have welcomed the initiative but expressed concerns about its success in handling peak-hour congestion. Experts emphasize the need for public cooperation and adherence to traffic rules for the system to deliver maximum benefits.</p>
                <p>If successful, Bengaluru’s AI-driven traffic solution could set a benchmark for other Indian cities grappling with similar challenges.</p>

                <p>New Delhi: In a significant move to address growing concerns over data privacy, the government introduced the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2025, in Parliament on Monday.

                <p>However, the bill has sparked debate.
